# simple_text_editor
Well a simple text editor, written on python.


For those who want to use the editor, goto the wiki tab and 
see the instructions for downloading and using.

For those who want the source code goto the source_code sub-branch
and there you find edi.py.

This is my first try for a nice,simple editor
and you are welcome to review and pull requests for making it more better.

Thank you for visiting.
